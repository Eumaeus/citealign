# `citealign`: release notes

**0.3.0**: Removed irritating debug code.

**0.2.0**: Added `corpusForAlignments(urnVec:Vector[Cite2Urn], expand:Boolean = false)`.

**0.1.0**: First version ready for testing in apps. Feature-complete except for CEX export. Basic, but not comprehensive, testing of all other features.

**0.0.1**: Project configured with updated Crossed-Compile stuff in SBT; compiles, runs tests (all "pending") in JVM and JS for Scala 1.11 and 1.12.
